Heart Disease Prediction Using ML with Python
 
Developed a machine learning model to predict heart disease based on a multivariate dataset from Kaggle, with 14 attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels and Thalassemia. One of the major tasks on this dataset is to predict based on the given attributes of a patient that whether that particular person has heart disease or not and other is the experimental task to diagnose and find out various insights from this dataset which could help in understanding the problem more. The project involved:

ðŸ‘‰ Machine Learning: Built and trained the model using logistic regression and explored insights using TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and pandas.
ðŸ‘‰ Frontend: Designed a user-friendly interface using React.js.
ðŸ‘‰ Backend: Implemented the API using FastAPI for seamless data processing and predictions.

This project enhanced my understanding of machine learning, model evaluation, and full-stack development, showcasing the ability to integrate technical skills with real-world healthcare applications.
